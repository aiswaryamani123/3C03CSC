         Lying in the southwestern tip of India, the green strip of Kerala sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea is unique and stands apart from the rest of the states in the country.</p>
        <p>

            Kerala's history is ancient, has centuries-old foreign trade links and a long tradition in art and literature. With a very high literacy rate, Kerala is at the forefront in setting high standards    in social justice, gender equality, health and education in the country.</p>
        <p>

An epitome of religious harmony, it was through Kerala that Christianity and Islam made its entry to India. And not just that! The country's first church and mosque are located in Kodungallur in central Kerala.      </p>
             <p>

Kerala is the spice garden of the world. Earlier, traders from far flung lands reached Kerala in search of the spices. Later, European powers followed this spice route to reach Kerala.</p>

<p>Enriched by Nature and abundance of water, Kerala can be reckoned as the land of rains. Its lifelines are the two rainy seasons of Idavappaathi and Thulavarsham.</p>

<p>Let us set out on a voyage through the history and culture of this land that is inimitable. A journey replete with vibrant colours, flavours and music â€¦. It will unravel to us the mysteries of Kerala.</p>
